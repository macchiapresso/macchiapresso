## Welcome 👋
🐰I am Macchi, aka "Cesar", a third year high school student from Brazil that is currently studying for med school entrance exams (ENEM/UFPR)
☕Although I don´t take coding that seriously, considering that my work area is completely apart from computers and engineering in general, I still enjoy tinkering a bit with Python, HTML/CSS/JS and Java.
