## Welcome 👋
<p>🐰I am Macchi, aka "Cesar", a student from Brazil that is currently waiting for med school entrance exam results</p>
<p>☕Although I don´t take coding that seriously, considering that my work area is completely apart from computers and engineering in general, I still enjoy tinkering a bit with Python, HTML/CSS/JS and Java.</p>
